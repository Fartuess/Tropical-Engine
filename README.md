### Features ###
* Component architecture
* Easy gameplay coding with IUpdate'able interface
* Level serialization
* Flexible system of managing shaders and materials
* Shaders builders allow creating shaders from modules. Shader builder can create shaders for multiple passes from one set of modules.
* Various lighting models (Phong, Blinn-Phong, Cook-Torrance, Strauss, Isotropic Ward, Anisotropic Ward)
* Bump mapping (normal mapping)
* Steep Parralax Mapping
* Alpha testing (aka masked translucency)
* Adaptive tessalation
* Vertex displacement and vector displacement.
* Directional lights
* Point lights
* Qt interface
* Custom style of interface
